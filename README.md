# LRU
This class defines a LRU data structure with a maximal size using a list to 
store the keys and a dictionary to store the values. The getValueByKey method 
prints the corresponding value for an existing key or NOTFOUND for a 
nonexisting key. The setKeyAndValue method insert a new key and its value to 
LRU, and maintain the LRU size.
